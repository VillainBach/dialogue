As your run-in with Elaine Sprouse and Dialect 4 no doubt proved, there is a great deal of power in books. A great deal of peril. If such books exist, it would be important to secure them. We have protocols for studying such things- reading sections without exposing a single agent to the whole. Do be in touch if you have noted any concerns like these. The other agents need not know the information came from you."
